# 90-day-backend-journey
This is a repository for my FastAPI learning journey

# Day 1 - 17/12/2025
Today, I have started my 90 days of backend. I have installed python, FastAPI, and uvicorn. I have also created a main.py file that will be my main file. The file has three endpoints: home, about and goals. I have also created this repo and pushed the file here.

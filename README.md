# 90-day-backend-journey
This is a repository for my FastAPI learning journey

# Day 1 - 17/12/2025
Today, I have started my 90 days of backend. I have read about FastAPI from the official docs, https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/first-steps/, and successfully installed python, FastAPI, and uvicorn. I have also created a main.py file that will be my main file. The file has three endpoints: home, about and goals. I have also created this repo and pushed the file here.I have also provided a screenshot to show that the endpoints are working perfectly. 
This task took me 2 hours, and all the endpoints and checks worked perfectly. Next, I tackle path parameters and query strings.
